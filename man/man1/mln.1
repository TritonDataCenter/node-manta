.TH mln 1 "May 2013" Manta "Manta Commands"
.SH NAME
.PP
mln \- make link between objects
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCmln\fR [OPTION...] TARGET LINK_NAME
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
mln creates a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.  Links in Manta are
allowed to be created by pointing at an object only, and are semantically
different than a UNIX link (both hard and soft).  Links in Manta are essentially
a "snapshot".  That is given object \fB\fCA\fR and a link \fB\fCB\fR to \fB\fCA\fR, when \fB\fCA\fR is
overwritten to be \fB\fCA'\fR, \fB\fCB\fR will still return the original value of \fB\fCA\fR\&.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Creates a link from README that snapshots the contents of README.md.
