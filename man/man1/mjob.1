.TH mjob 1 "May 2013" Manta "Manta Commands"
.SH NAME
.PP
mjob \- manage manta jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCmjob\fR [OPTION...] command [command\-specific arguments]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
mjob allows you to interact with jobs in Manta. Jobs allow you to specify
arbitrary compute that operates on manta objects, with Map/Reduce supported
as a first\-class citizen.  Using mjob, you can create, read, monitor and cancel
jobs.
.PP
The primary reference for a job is its UUID.  Most commands operate on jobs by
UUID.
.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported in all commands:
.TP
\fB\fC-a, --account login\fR
Authenticate as account (login name).
.TP
\fB\fC-h, --help\fR
Print a help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\fC-i, --insecure\fR
This option explicitly allows "insecure" SSL connections and transfers.  All
SSL connections are attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate
.TP
bundle installed by default.
\fB\fC-k, --key fingerprint\fR
Authenticate using the SSH key described by \fB\fCfingerprint\fR.  The key must
either be in \fB\fC~/.ssh\fR or loaded in the SSH agent via \fB\fCssh-add\fR.
.TP
\fB\fC-p, --parallel concurrency\fR
Limit concurrent operations to CONCURRENCY.  Default is 50.
.TP
\fB\fC-u, --url url\fR
Manta base URL (such as \fB\fChttps://manta.us-east.joyent.com\fR).
.TP
\fB\fC-v, --verbose\fR
Print debug output to stderr.  Repeat option to increase verbosity.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
The following commands and options are supported:
.SS create [OPTIONS...] expression
.PP
Creates a job that executes the commands against keys that will be specified
via \fB\fCaddinputs\fR.  \fB\fCexpression\fR can specify an arbitrary UNIX pipeline, with
map/reduce \fIphases\fP separated by the \fB\fC^\fR or \fB\fC^^\fR 
.BR character (s), 
respectively.
.PP
For example, to specify a simple \fB\fCgrep | sort | uniq\fR job in Manta, the
following invocation would be a likely example (note the | to escape the
\fB\fC|\fR character):
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob create grep foo ^^ sort \\| uniq -c
.fi
.RE
.PP
This is the fastest and most common form of creating jobs, and runs with default
compute container sizes.
.PP
Alternatively, jobs can be specified by using a combination of \fB\fC-m\fR and \fB\fC-r\fR
flags; the same pipeline could be specified with:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob create -m 'grep foo' -r 'sort | uniq -c'
.fi
.RE
.PP
The above form is useful for specifying options to each phase.  For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob create --memory 2048 -m 'grep foo' --memory 8192 -r 'sort | uniq -c'
.fi
.RE
.PP
Overrides the amount of RAM available in each phase (the \fB\fCmemory\fR, \fB\fCdisk\fR,
\fB\fCinit\fR and \fB\fCcount\fR options impact the \fInext\fP phase).
.PP
Jobs can also be specified using a JSON manifest file, as below (see Manta
API documentation for the full JSON schema):
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ cat job.json
{
  "phases": [{
    "exec": "grep ..."
  }, {
    "exec": "maggr sum | sort",
    "type": "reduce"
  }]
}
$ mjob create -f job.json
.fi
.RE
.PP
Lastly, \fB\fCmjob create\fR can "one line" the use of create, addinputs, watch and
get like the example below; this would print no diagnostics, and would wait
for the job to complete, then dump the output to stdout (as if you had run
\fB\fCfind | grep | sort | uniq\fR locally):
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mfind /$MANTA_USER/stor | mjob create -q -o grep foo ^^ sort \\| uniq -c
.fi
.RE
.PP
The following options are supported on \fB\fCcreate\fR:
.TP
\fB\fC-b, --batch size\fR
When adding inputs, add them in batches of size.
.TP
\fB\fC--count num_reducers\fR
Use num_reducers in the reduce phase.
.TP
\fB\fC--disk disk\fR
Override the OS quota, and use the specified amount of disk in the next phase.
This option is specified in gigabytes.
.TP
\fB\fC--memory memory\fR
Override the OS size, and use the specified amount of DRAM in the next phase.
This option is specified in megabytes.
.TP
\fB\fC-f, --file file\fR
Read job description from file.
.TP
\fB\fC--image version\fR
Specifies an image version semver to use in job phases.  Must be specified as
a semver string (default is ~1.0).
.TP
\fB\fC--init path\fR
Specifies an asset to make available in the compute zone that runs \fIbefore\fP
the exec command.  This is useful for setup, etc.
.TP
\fB\fC-m, --map command\fR
Specifies a map phase.
.TP
\fB\fC-o, --cat-outputs\fR
Wait for job to complete, then fetch and concatenate outputs.
.TP
\fB\fC--open\fR
When adding inputs, do not close input, but leave job open.
.TP
\fB\fC-q, --quiet\fR
Do not output any informative messages.
.TP
\fB\fC-r, --reduce command\fR
Specifies a reduce phase.
.TP
\fB\fC-s, --assets path\fR
Specifies an asset to make available in the compute zone.
.TP
\fB\fC-w, --watch\fR
Wait for job to finish (only use when adding inputs at create time).
.SS addinputs [\-b batch] [\-o] JOB...
.PP
The addinputs command feeds input names from stdin to a list of JobIDs,
and by default closes input when done.  For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ cat inputs.txt
/$MANTA_USER/stor/foo
/$MANTA_USER/stor/bar
$ cat inputs.txt | mjob addinputs $job
.fi
.RE
.TP
\fB\fC-b, --batch size\fR
When adding inputs, add them in batches of size.
.TP
\fB\fC-o, --open\fR
When adding inputs, do not close input, but leave job open.
.SS get JOB...
.PP
Returns the \fB\fCstatus\fR JSON document for a job.
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob get 3ec32136-b125-11e2-8487-1b418dd6974b
.fi
.RE
.SS watch JOB
.PP
Waits for a given job to reach the \fB\fCdone\fR state.
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob watch 3ec32136-b125-11e2-8487-1b418dd6974b
.fi
.RE
.SS cancel JOB...
.PP
Cancels a currently running job.
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob cancel 3ec32136-b125-11e2-8487-1b418dd6974b
.fi
.RE
.SS outputs JOB...
.PP
Returns the list of outputs for a job, as \fB\fC\\n\fR separated names.  Note that while
a job is specifically \fInot archived\fP, the list of names is not guaranteed to
be complete or consistent between calls (in particular when there are a large
number of outputs).  Once a job is archived, the entire set of names are read
back in a contiguous stream.
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob outputs 3ec32136-b125-11e2-8487-1b418dd6974b
.fi
.RE
.SS inputs JOB...
.PP
Returns the list of inputs for a job, as \fB\fC\\n\fR separated names.  Note that while
a job is specifically \fInot archived\fP, the list of names is not guaranteed to
be complete or consistent between calls (in particular when there are a large
number of outputs).  Once a job is archived, the entire set of names are read
back in a contiguous stream.
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob inputs 3ec32136-b125-11e2-8487-1b418dd6974b
.fi
.RE
.SS errors JOB...
.PP
Returns the list of errors for a job, as \fB\fC\\n\fR separated JSON objects.  Note that
while a job is specifically \fInot archived\fP, the list of errors is not guaranteed
to be complete or consistent between calls (in particular when there are a large
number of outputs).  Once a job is archived, the entire set of errors are read
back in a contiguous stream.
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob errors 3ec32136-b125-11e2-8487-1b418dd6974b
.fi
.RE
.SS failures JOB...
.PP
Returns the list of failed inputs for a job, as \fB\fC\\n\fR separated names.  Note that
while a job is specifically \fInot archived\fP, the list of names is not guaranteed
to be complete or consistent between calls (in particular when there are a large
number of outputs).  Once a job is archived, the entire set of names are read
back in a contiguous stream.
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob failures 3ec32136-b125-11e2-8487-1b418dd6974b
.fi
.RE
.SS list [\-s state]
.PP
Lists all jobs for a user (note, this can also be done with a normal \fB\fCmls\fR
call).  Optionally takes a \fB\fC-s\fR, that can be used to filter down to only
\fB\fCrunning\fR jobs.
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ mjob list -s running
.fi
.RE
.TP
\fB\fC-s, --state state\fR
Only list jobs in the given state.
