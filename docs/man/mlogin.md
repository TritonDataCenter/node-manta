mlogin 1 "August 2017" Manta "Manta Commands"
===========================================

NAME
----

mlogin - manta interactive session client

SYNOPSIS
--------

`mlogin` [OPTION...] [OBJECT]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`mlogin` allows you to spawn an interactive job in Manta. Once running, your
terminal will be attached to the remote process running in the job via a shell
session tunneled through HTTPS, similar in concept to SSH.

Interactive sessions are a great way to debug a new job script in-situ, or to
experience and explore the compute zone environment hands on.  It can also
become part of a workflow using interactive terminal utilities on large Manta
objects without the need to download or transfer the data -- e.g. the the use
of `mdb` (the Modular Debugger) on crash dumps and core files.

The mlogin session terminates when the top level process has exited (usually the
interactive shell, unless the `-c` option was used) and all references to that
process's controlling terminal have also been closed.  Beware that if you fork a
background process and then exit the shell, the background process (and the job)
may continue running if they hold the terminal open.  You may need to cancel the
job in order to stop it.

Note that `mlogin` makes use of publicly-readable assets stored under the
"poseidon" account, which is provided by the system.


EXAMPLES
--------

The default mode of `mlogin` is to create a reduce job with no input keys.  This
job has no input data, but gets you a shell running in a Manta compute zone.

    $ mlogin
     * created interactive job
     * waiting for session... established
    user@manta # ptree $$
    91352 zsched
      2701  ./node lib/agent.js
        2715  /bin/bash --norc
          2735  ptree 2715
    user@manta # exit
     * remote process exited
     * cleaning up resources...
     * session complete

A more complicated use of `mlogin` would be crashdump analysis with `mdb`:

    $ mlogin -c 'mdb /manta/user/stor/vmcore.1' /user/stor/vmcore.1
     * created interactive job
     * waiting for session... established

OPTIONS
-------

The options are supported:

`-a, --account login`
  Authenticate as account (login name).

`-c, --command shell_command`
  Run `shell_command` instead of the default shell. This will be passed to
  `bash -c` inside the interactive job, and can be used to run a command
  other than the default interactive shell.  Can be especially useful when
  you provide a script or program to run via `--assets`.

`--disk disk`
  Override the OS quota, and use the specified amount of disk.
  This option is specified in gigabytes.

`-e, --escape escape_character`
  Sets the escape character for this mlogin session.  This character is
  recognised immediately following a carriage return, and allows the user
  to perform a session control function.  If the escape character is
  followed by a period (`.`), the session will end; followed by a
  question mark (`?`) prints a list of available escape characters.
  Passing `"none"` to the `-e` flag disables the escape character entirely.

`-h, --help`
  Print a help message and exit.

`--image version`
  Specifies an image version semver to use in job phases.  Must be specified as
  a semver string (default is ~1.0).

`--init command`
  Specifies a command to execute in the compute zone.  This command will be
  executed prior to starting the interactive job.  This is useful for setup,
  etc.

`-i, --insecure`
  This option explicitly allows "insecure" SSL connections and transfers.  All
  SSL connections are attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate
  bundle installed by default.

`-k, --key fingerprint`
  Authenticate using the SSH key described by `fingerprint`.  The key must
  either be in `~/.ssh` or loaded in the SSH agent via `ssh-add`.

`--memory memory`
  Override the OS size, and use the specified amount of DRAM.
  This option is specified in megabytes.

`--role=ROLE,ROLE,...`
  Specify which roles to assume for the request.

`-s, --assets path`
  Specifies an asset to make available in the compute zone.

`--user user`
  Authenticate as user under account.

`-u, --url url`
  Manta base URL (such as `https://us-central.manta.mnx.io`).

`-v, --verbose`
  Print debug output to stderr.  Repeat option to increase verbosity.

`-q, --quiet`
  Don't print session establishment status messages.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

`MANTA_USER`
  In place of `-a, --account`.

`MANTA_SUBUSER`
  In place of `--user`.

`MANTA_KEY_ID`
  In place of `-k, --key`.

`MANTA_ROLE`
  In place of `--role`.

`MANTA_URL`
  In place of `-u, --url`.

`MANTA_TLS_INSECURE`
  In place of `-i, --insecure`.

The shortcut `~~` is equivalent to `/:login`
where `:login` is the account login name.

BUGS
----

DSA keys do not work when loaded via the SSH agent.
