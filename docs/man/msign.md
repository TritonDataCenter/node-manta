msign 1 "July 2013" Manta "Manta Commands"
=======================================

NAME
----

msign - create a signed URL to a Manta object

SYNOPSIS
--------

`msign` [OPTION...] OBJECT...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

msign takes a list of objects (or directories), and using the credentials from
the environment (whether environment variables or command line switches) creates
time-expiring URLs that can be shared with others.  This is useful to generate
HTML links, for example.

The default expiration for URLs is 1 hour from `now`, but this can be changed
with the `expires` option.  The expires option is designed to be used in
conjunction with the UNIX date command.  In general, you should use the date
command with a modifier (the syntax is different between BSD and GNU forms), and
format the output to epoch time or use an ISO 8601 format.

EXAMPLES
--------

Assuming the GNU date command, generate a signed URL that expires in one month:

    $ msign -e $(date -d "1 month" "+%s") /$MANTA_USER/stor/tmp

On OS X, you would sign this way:

    $ msign -e $(date -v+1 "+%s") /$MANTA_USER/stor/tmp


OPTIONS
-------

`-a, --account login`
  Authenticate as account (login name).

`-e, --expires expiration`
  Signed URL should last until EXPIRATION (seconds since epoch).  Default is 1
  hour from `now`.

`-h, --help`
  Print a help message and exit.

`-i, --insecure`
  This option explicitly allows "insecure" SSL connections and transfers.  All
  SSL connections are attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate
  bundle installed by default.

`-k, --key fingerprint`
  Authenticate using the SSH key described by FINGERPRINT.  The key must
  either be in `~/.ssh` or loaded in the SSH agent via `ssh-add`.

`-m, --method http_method`
  Allow URL to work for the HTTP method specified (default is GET).

`-u, --url url`
  Manta base URL (such as `https://manta.us-east.joyent.com`).

`-v, --verbose`
  Print debug output to stderr.  Repeat option to increase verbosity.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

`MANTA_USER`
  In place of `-a, --account`

`MANTA_KEY_ID`
  In place of `-k, --key`.

`MANTA_URL`
  In place of `-u, --url`.

`MANTA_TLS_INSECURE`
  In place of `-i, --insecure`.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

When using the `-v` option, diagnostics will be sent to stderr in bunyan
output format.  As an example of tracing all information about a request,
try:

    $ msign -vv /$MANTA_USER/stor/foo 2>&1 | bunyan

BUGS
----

DSA keys do not work when loaded via the SSH agent.
