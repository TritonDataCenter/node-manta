# Manta client tools

[manta](http://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/nodesdk.html) is a Node.js SDK for
interacting with Joyent's Manta system.

This repository is part of the Joyent [Manta](http://github.com/joyent/manta)
project.  See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.

# Installation

    $ npm install manta -g


### Bash completion

Optionally install Bash completion. This is done by `source`ing the
"share/manta.completion" file that is installed with the tools. If you
installed with `npm install manta -g` as above, then that is:

```bash
source $(npm prefix -g)/lib/node_modules/manta/share/manta.completion
```

Put that (or the equivalent) in your "~/.bashrc" file to make it permanent.

You can verify that completions are working by typing the `TAB` key with
the following:

    $ mls --<TAB>
    --account   --insecure  --long      --role      --type      --verbose
    --fulljson  --json      --marker    --subuser   --url       --version
    --help      --keyId     --reverse   --time      --user


# Usage

First setup your environment to match your Joyent Manta account:

    $ export MANTA_KEY_ID=`ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\n'`
    $ export MANTA_URL=https://us-east.manta.joyent.com
    $ export MANTA_USER=mark

Then a code snippet:

    var assert = require('assert');
    var fs = require('fs');
    var manta = require('manta');

    var client = manta.createClient({
        sign: manta.privateKeySigner({
            key: fs.readFileSync(process.env.HOME + '/.ssh/id_rsa', 'utf8'),
            keyId: process.env.MANTA_KEY_ID,
            user: process.env.MANTA_USER
        }),
        user: process.env.MANTA_USER,
        url: process.env.MANTA_URL
    });
    console.log('manta ready: %s', client.toString());

    client.get('/mark/stor/foo', function (err, stream) {
        assert.ifError(err);

        stream.setEncoding('utf8');
        stream.on('data', function (chunk) {
            console.log(chunk);
        });
    });

If your paths begin with `'~~/'` then manta will automatically fill in the current manta user, which helps
you write more generic code since you get rid of the hardcoded user name. The following two rows are identical:

    client.get('/mark/stor/foo', function (err, stream) {});
    client.get('~~/stor/foo', function (err, stream) {});

# CLI

Basic commands include:

1. mls - lists directory contents, default /:user/stor
2. mput - uploads data to a Manta object
3. mget - downloads an object from Manta
4. mjob - creates and runs a computational job on Manta
5. mfind - walks a Manta hierarchy to find names of objects by name, size, or type

A full set of commands for interacting with Manta is in `bin`.

# Testing

Running this test suite will create files in Manta (using your current
`MANTA_*` environment variables).

    make test

The set of test files run can be filtered:

    make test TEST_FILTER=muntar

As well, you can get debug/trace logging (note that we intentionally avoid
`LOG_LEVEL` because the `m*` tools use that and sharing the same envvar can
break tests):

    make test TEST_LOG_LEVEL=trace 2>&1 | bunyan


There is a mechanism to re-build and test with a number of installed node
versions. First you must create "test/node.paths" (based on
"test/node.paths.example") and then:

    make testall

# Bugs

See <https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues>.

# Release process

Here is how to cut a release:

1. Make a commit to set the intended version in "package.json#version" and
   changing `## not yet released` at the top of "CHANGES.md" to:

    ```
    ## not yet released


    ## $version
    ```

2. Get that commit approved and merged via <https://cr.joyent.us>, as with all
   commits to this repo. See the discussion of contribution at the top of this
   readme.

3. Once that is merged and you've updated your local copy, run:

    ```
    make cutarelease
    ```

   This will run a couple checks (clean working copy, versions in package.json
   and CHANGES.md match), then will git tag and npm publish.
