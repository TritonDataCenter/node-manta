# NOTE: This makefile comes from the "eng" repo. It's designed to be dropped
# into other repos as-is without requiring any modifications. If you find
# yourself changing this file, you should instead update the original copy in

#
# This makefile defines some useful defines. Include it at the top of
# your Makefile.
#
# Definitions in this Makefile:
#
#	TOP 		The absolute path to the project directory. The top dir.
#	BRANCH 		The current git branch.
#	TIMESTAMP	The timestamp for the build. This can be set via
#			the TIMESTAMP envvar (used by MG-based builds).
#	STAMP		A build stamp to use in built package names.
