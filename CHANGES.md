# node-manta Changelog

## not yet released

- added -p to man mput

## 3.1.1

  "socket hang up"

## 3.1.0

        $ mfind -j ~~/stor/tmp
        {"name":"foo-file.gz","etag":"142ad91b-73d8-6cb4-9cd9-efacf7df7a9a","size":229535627,"type":"object","mtime":"2014-10-08T22:53:25.146Z","durability":2,"parent":"/trent.mick/stor/tmp","depth":0}

## 3.0.0

- joyent/node-manta#246 Update many dependencies to come up to the modern age.
  This involved dropping support for node 0.8. It is for this reason, and
  prudence at the large number of dependency updates (many of them across
  major version bumps) that we are doing a major version bump of this package.
  For node >=0.10 users there aren't any *known* backwards incompatibilities.
- MANTA-2937: mchmod client-side workaround for MANTA-2929 InvalidUpdateError

## 2.0.7

- joyent/node-manta#252 2.0.6 breaks msign with ssh-agent and RSA keys

## 2.0.6

- joyent/node-manta#250 msign should let smartdc-auth decide what algorithm
  to use. Fixes msign with ECDSA keys (so the -g option is no longer needed)

## 2.0.5

- PUBAPI-1214 update smartdc-auth to sshpk-agent 1.2.1, to fix a number of
  bad-state issues arising when using node-manta under heavy load with the
  ssh-agent

## 2.0.4

- MANTA-2812, PUBAPI-1197 fix up support for custom request signers, and
  handle "null signers" properly (prevent the generation of an Authorization
  header)

## 2.0.3

- Updated smartdc-auth version, eliminates duplicated code from http-signature

## 2.0.2

- Updated smartdc-auth version for repeatable builds.

## 2.0.1

- Updated smartdc-auth version for fixes with ED25519 keys.

## 2.0.0

- Change to use latest node-smartdc-auth for signing and authentication.
  This solves a number of issues around key loading and signing, especially
  with the SSH agent. The loadSSHKey method is known to be incompatible,
  but other auth-related API is preserved.

## 1.6.0

- #237 new `createListStream()` API, a second-generation streaming version
  of `ls()`
- #238 mls `--type` flag now works correctly, allowing the user to list only
  objects, or only directories

  This issue can also manifest as "TypeError: Not a buffer".
