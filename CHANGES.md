  `mls` now supports `-h` for human readable output with `-l`, ie: `mls -lh`.

  **Note:** this means `-h` is no longer an alias for `--help`.

## 5.3.0

Support for the in-development Buckets features of Manta:

- New "Buckets"-related methods on the `MantaBucketsClient` subclass of
  `MantaClient`:
    - createListBucketsStream
    - isBucketsSupported
    - createBucket
    - deleteBucket
    - createListBucketObjectsStream
    - createBucketObject
    - headBucketObject
    - deleteBucketObject
- A new `mbucket` CLI:
    - mbucket ls - listing buckets
    - mbucket raw - for dev/debugging the raw Manta API
    - mbucket is-supported - hidden command for testing `isBucketsSupported`.
    - mbucket mb - Create bucket
    - mbucket rb - Delete bucket
    - mbucket cp - Copy files to and from a Manta bucket.
    - mbucket rm - Delete a Manta bucket object.
    - mbucket info - Print HTTP headers for a given Manta bucket or object.
- Known issues/limitations:
    - '/' in object names is messed up
    - metadata endpoints are not yet implemented
    - testing is lacking
    - currently this is a first pass implementation that needs another go over
    - lots of options are missing for which the intent is to implement:
      --recursive, --dry-run, etc.
    - missing docs: API docs in docs/index.md; user guide docs
    - `mbucket ls` does not support pagination or non-recursive listing
      with common prefixes (waiting on MANTA-4355 work)
    - RBAC roles are not yet supported



## 5.2.1

- [MANTA-3679](https://smartos.org/bugview/MANTA-3679) content-md5 bugs in
  muskie GetJob and node-manta 'mjob get' lead to BadDigest for non-ascii
  content.

  Fixes a rare bug that can cause a Content-MD5 failure in `mjob get` against a
  Manta webapi using a different version.

## 5.2.0

- [#61](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/61) msign should allow for
  friendlier expiry date formats

  `msign -E <expires>` now supported, e.g.

      msign -E 30m ~~/stor/bar # 30 minutes from now
      msign -E 1h ~~/stor/foo  # 1 hour from now

- [#333](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/333) The --role-tag option
  does not work  for mput, muntar, mln, or mmkdir
- [#329](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/329) Refactor all commands
  to use common option parsing code
- [#343](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/343) Want `mjob wait` as
  alias for `mjob watch`

## 5.1.1

- [#315](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/315) document mlogin
  session termination conditions

## 5.1.0

Minor version bump due to a backwards-compatible addition to the multipart
upload client operations. The client operations now allow for a
`partsDirectory` string on the options object for multipart upload methods,
which is used as the URL of the request. Otherwise, the parts directory is
resolved using the server's redirect endpoint.

- [#325](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/325) ask server for fully
  qualified upload path
- [#326](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/326) client could support
  accepting fully qualified upload directory as input to MPU operations

## 5.0.0

If you do not check explicitly for `ResourceNotFoundErrors` from multipart
upload operations, this major bump will not affect you. Code that checks for a
`ResourceNotFoundError` in the error cause chain using
[VError](https://github.com/joyent/node-verror)'s `findCauseByName` or
`hasCauseWithName` will continue to work.

Major bump due to a change in the errors that may be returned from client
multipart upload operations. In particular, if Manta returns a
`ResourceNotFoundError` for an MPU operation, it is presumed that the Manta
deployment does not have the multipart upload API enabled. The client will now
return a `FeatureNotSupportedError` from the methods `createUpload`,
`uploadPart`, `abortUpload`, `getUpload`, and `commitUpload` in this case, with
the `ResourceNotFoundError` preserved in the call chain.
Code that specifically checks for the error name `ResourceNotFoundError` to
detect whether multipart upload is supported should be updated appropriately
to use VError.hasCauseWithName.

- [#320](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/320) client should detect
  if MPU is enabled
- [#319](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/319) MPU-related tests
  should detect if MPU is supported

## 4.5.0

Minor bump due to a backwards-compatible addition to the `commitUpload` method
on the client. The `commitUpload` method now passes the response from the server
to the callback.

- [#323](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/323) return response
  argument from client.commitUpload
- [#318](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/318) node-manta nodejs
  version support
- [#322](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/322) test7 make target
  should be test8 given node v8
- [#321](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/321) document mlogin's use
  of poseidon assets

## 4.4.3

- [#244](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/244) mlogin could disable
  Manta's abort-on-core behavior

## 4.4.2

- [#312](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/312) Custom header input
  should tolerate ':' characters

## 4.4.1

- [#302](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/302) Create a manual page
  for `mmpu`
- [#311](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/311) `createUpload`
  incorrectly handles some target object headers

## 4.4.0

- [#308](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/308) `mmpu commit` does
  not parse options
- [#309](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/309) MPU tests are out of
  sync with Muskie master branch implementation

## 4.3.0

- MANTA-2169: Support multipart upload of a single file to Manta

## 4.2.0

Minor bump due to relaxation of API requirements in `mfind` (NotFound
errors are no longer fatal unless none of the arguments are found)

- [#230](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/230) mlogin resists
  request-level debugging
- [#298](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/298) mjob-simple fails
  because of GNU date regression
- [#281](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/281) mfind NotFound errors
  should not be fatal.

## 4.1.1

- [#293](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/293) ~~ evaluation needs
  to be less pedantic
- [#294](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/294) content-length and
  transfer-encoding chunked must not be used together

## 4.1.0

- [#214](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/214) basic bash tab
  completion
- [#288](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/288) mfind of file blows
  assertion: "ent (object) is required"

## 4.0.0

- [#272](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/272) `m*` tools should
  have a `--version` option
- [#282](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/282) mchmod ignores all(?)
  options

  *BREAKING CHANGE* `mchmod` now parses all standard options. The use of the
  `--` form is encouraged to avoid ambiguities in role versus option names (ex:
  `mchmod -- -read,write ~~/stor/foo.txt`).  This is a breaking change for some
  ambiguous invocations of mchmod that worked by accident before. For example
  this:

        mchmod -read,write ~~/stor/foo.txt      # worked before, fails in v4
        mchmod -- -read,write ~~/stor/foo.txt   # works in both major versions

- [#280](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/280) job expressions do
  not honor --memory

  Ensure that `--disk`, `--memory`, and `--init` options are used with `mjob
  create MAP_PHASE ^ MAP_PHASE ^^ REDUCE_PHASE` style job creation.
- [#279](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/279) mjob should expressly
  list out allowed sizes for memory

  Improvements to help output for all CLIs.  Also add the `mjob create
  --dry-run ...` option to print the created job object and exit. This is
  useful for exploring and testing `mjob create`s many options.

## 3.1.3

- [#277](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/277) mjob fails with mjob:
  AssertionError: body (object) is required

## 3.1.2

- [#275](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/275) msign with subusers
  broken
- [#270](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/270) Add -p to man mput

## 3.1.1

- [#261](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/261) "AssertionError:
  undefined (object) is required" after "socket hang up"

## 3.1.0

- [#265](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/265) `mfind --json,-j`

        $ mfind -j ~~/stor/tmp
        {"name":"foo-file.gz","etag":"142ad91b-73d8-6cb4-9cd9-efacf7df7a9a","size":229535627,"type":"object","mtime":"2014-10-08T22:53:25.146Z","durability":2,"parent":"/trent.mick/stor/tmp","depth":0}
        {"name":"foo.imgmanifest","etag":"88ac47b9-e53f-c065-b446-e2d0455c0c00","size":1052,"type":"object","mtime":"2014-10-08T22:52:44.298Z","durability":2,"parent":"/trent.mick/stor/tmp","depth":0}

## 3.0.0

- [#246](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/issues/246) Update dependencies
  for a Node v6 age.
  This involved dropping support for node 0.8. It is for this reason, and
  prudence at the large number of dependency updates (many of them across
  major version bumps) that we are doing a major version bump of this package.
  For node >=0.10 users there aren't any *known* backwards incompatibilities.
- MANTA-2937: mchmod client-side workaround for MANTA-2929 InvalidUpdateError

  bad-state issues arising when using node-manta under heavy load with the
  ssh-agent

## 2.0.4

- MANTA-2812, PUBAPI-1197 fix up support for custom request signers, and
  handle "null signers" properly (prevent the generation of an Authorization
  header)

## 2.0.3

- Updated smartdc-auth version, eliminates duplicated code from http-signature

## 2.0.2
